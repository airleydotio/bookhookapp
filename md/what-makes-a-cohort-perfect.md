Perfect cohort, What’s that? Imagine this, you created a cohort based course to share your hard earned knowledge with the world. The cohort is running smoothly, and you have learners and followers enrolled in the course, which is being promoted by them across the internet, and you are experiencing the love and support of your students. All while continuing to work at your day job. Sounds both lovely and exhausting at the same time. Right?

Starting a cohort-based course can be highly rewarding as it offers a unique opportunity to foster deep learning, community engagement, and skill development. According to a report by [Learnopoly](https://learnopoly.com/cohort-based-learning-statistics/), online learning with a cohort-based approach has shown a completion rate of 90%, significantly higher than traditional online courses, which typically hover around 3%. Additionally, a study by eLearning Industry found that 93% of learners in cohort-based courses reported higher engagement and interaction levels, underscoring the value of this model in enhancing the learning experience and improving outcomes.

## **What is Cohort-Based Learning? Is it a gimmick?**

Cohort-based learning is an educational approach where a group of learners join a structured learning journey together, progressing through a course or program in synchrony. Unlike self-paced courses, where learners can enroll at any time and proceed at their own speed, cohort-based courses have fixed start and end dates, fostering a sense of community and shared progress among participants.

In a cohort-based learning setting, learners engage with course content, assignments, and discussions as part of a community. They often have access to live sessions, discussions, and collaborative activities that encourage active participation and peer-to-peer interaction. This shared experience creates a dynamic and supportive learning environment that sets cohort-based learning apart from traditional online courses.

## **Benefits of Cohort-Based Courses for Instructors:**

We mean pre-recorded courses worked best for so long or at least we’ve seen it working best for others ;) Well here’s why you need to consider cohort based courses:

- **Build Stronger Connections with Your Learners**: Cohort-based courses allow instructors to forge meaningful connections with their students. The shared journey fosters trust and camaraderie, leading to more effective teaching and learning.
- **Give and Receive Immediate Feedback**: Live sessions and discussions provide a platform for instructors to give immediate feedback to learners. This interaction accelerates the learning process and helps learners stay on track.
- **Community Building Drives Word-of-Mouth**: A strong cohort community becomes a positive word-of-mouth marketing tool. Satisfied learners are more likely to recommend your courses to others.
- **Significant and Measurable Impact on Learners’ Skills**: Cohort-based courses have a track record of producing tangible results. Learners acquire skills and knowledge that they can apply immediately in their careers.
- **Monetization Opportunities Are Better**: Cohort-based courses often command premium pricing due to their interactive nature and the value they deliver. This creates monetization opportunities for instructors.

That sounds interesting, right? We know. Now you're probably wondering 'How do I launch a cohort course?’

## **Planning Your Cohort-Based Course**

### 1. **Defining Your Course**

- **Identify the Course's Main Objectives and Learning Outcomes**: Clearly define what specific skills or knowledge your learners should acquire by the end of the course. For instance, if you're creating a cohort-based course on product marketing, your objectives could include teaching learners how to develop effective marketing strategies, optimize websites for search engines, and analyze product metrics.
- **Determine the Target Audience and Their Skill Levels**: Understand your audience's background and needs. Are they beginners, intermediates, or advanced practitioners in the field? Tailor the course content and delivery to suit them. For beginners, start with foundational concepts and gradually progress to more advanced topics.
- **Choose a Compelling and Focused Course Topic**: Select a topic that aligns with your expertise and is of interest to your target audience. For example, if you're an experienced project manager, you might create a course on "Mastering Agile Project Management for IT Professionals."

### 2. **Setting Course Duration and Frequency**

- **Decide on the Course Length and Structure**: Balance the depth of content with learners' time commitments. For in-depth topics, a 10-week course with weekly modules may work well, while a shorter 4-week course could suit more focused skill development.
- **Determine the Frequency of Live Sessions and Interactions**: Live sessions are integral to cohort-based learning. Decide how often they will occur. For instance, weekly live sessions and discussions maintain a consistent learning pace and encourage active participation.

### 3. **Curriculum Development**

- **Break Down the Course into Modules or Units**: Divide the content into logical sections or modules, each covering a specific aspect of the overall topic. For a marketing course, modules might include "Social Media Marketing," "Content Marketing," and "Email Marketing."
- **Outline Topics and Subtopics for Each Module**: Align topics and subtopics with your learning objectives. In the "Social Media Marketing" module, subtopics might include "Choosing the Right Social Media Platforms" and "Crafting Engaging Social Media Content."
- **Balance Theory and Practical Application**: Ensure a balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application. For UI design, combine theoretical discussions on best practices with hands-on exercises where learners create and optimize designs.

## **Designing Engaging Course Content**

### 1. **Diversify Learning Materials**

Incorporate a variety of content formats: live sessions, videos, readings, quizzes, assignments, case studies, etc. Variety keeps learners engaged and caters to different learning preferences. For instance, live sessions deliver conceptual knowledge, readings provide in-depth information, quizzes assess understanding, and assignments facilitate practical application.

### 2. **Developing Interactive Assignments**

Design assignments that encourage critical thinking and practical application. Challenge learners to apply what they've learned to real-world scenarios or problems. For example, in a product management course, an assignment could involve creating a product roadmap for a fictional product, requiring learners to perform related activities.

Provide timely feedback on assignments. It is crucial for learners to understand their strengths and areas for improvement. Use guidelines to ensure consistency in grading and feedback. Encourage peer feedback and self-assessment for collaborative learning and self-reflection.

## **Fostering Active Engagement**

### 1. **Live Sessions and Webinars**

- Deliver high-quality live sessions with clear audio and visuals. Invest in good-quality equipment for audio-visual quality and use appropriate lighting. Keep lectures concise and engaging, focusing on key concepts and practical examples. Use storytelling techniques to connect emotionally with learners and illustrate complex concepts with real-life examples.
- Consider conducting live Q&A sessions or webinars with guest speakers to allow learners to directly interact with industry experts.

### 2. **Collaborative Learning**

- Create a dedicated discussion forum where learners can share thoughts, exchange ideas, and troubleshoot challenges. Encourage learners to ask questions, share perspectives, and provide feedback on each other's work. Actively participate in discussions as an instructor to guide and moderate conversations.
- Implement discussion prompts or assignments that require learners to collaborate and solve real-world problems together.

### 3. **Office Hours and Personalized Support**

- Offer office hours to provide personalized attention and support. Set aside dedicated time slots for learners to seek clarification on challenging concepts or receive feedback on their assignments. This personalized approach strengthens the bond between learners and the instructor.

## **Building a Strong Community**

### 1. **Cultivating a Cohort Culture**

- Emphasize the importance of community and collaboration from the outset. Make it clear that community and collaboration are core values of your cohort-based course. Share success stories and testimonials from previous cohorts to highlight the positive impact of community.
- Establish ground rules for respectful communication and participation within the cohort. Encourage active listening, constructive feedback, and openness to diverse perspectives.

### 2. **Networking Opportunities**

- Organize virtual meetups or networking events to provide learners with opportunities to connect beyond the course content. Encourage participants to share experiences, challenges, and insights.
- Connect learners with industry professionals and mentors. Invite guest speakers to networking events, where learners can ask questions and seek advice. Consider creating a mentorship program within your cohort-based course.

## **Assessing and Iterating**

### 1. **Continuous Assessment**

Incorporate quizzes at the end of each module to assess learners' understanding of key concepts. Ensure that questions test both theoretical knowledge and practical application.

### 2. **Soliciting Feedback**

Collect feedback through surveys or dedicated feedback sessions. Periodically gather insights from learners to understand their experiences and identify areas for improvement. Pay attention to common pain points and areas of confusion.

### 3. **Iterating for Future Cohorts**

Use feedback to enhance course content and structure. Focus on making data-driven improvements. Expand on topics that engage learners and adjust content based on feedback. Commit to continuous improvement to benefit each new cohort..
